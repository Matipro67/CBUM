      <td colspan="4">Chris &ldquo;CBum&rdquo; Bumstead, born on February 2, 1995, in Ottawa, Canada, is a retired Canadian professional bodybuilder widely regarded as one of the greatest Classic Physique competitors in history. Growing up, he was an athletic kid who played multiple sports, including football, baseball, basketball, and hockey, before discovering weight training at the age of 14. His early progress in the gym caught the attention of his sister&rsquo;s boyfriend, professional bodybuilder Iain Valliere, who would later become a major mentor and influence in his bodybuilding journey. Bumstead began competing in bodybuilding in 2014 and quickly rose through the ranks due to his combination of aesthetics, symmetry, and disciplined work ethic. In 2016, he earned his IFBB Pro Card by winning the IFBB North American Bodybuilding Championship. His Classic Physique debut at the Mr. Olympia came in 2017, where he placed second, a position he repeated in 2018. In 2019, he captured his first <strong data-start="1048" data-end="1086">Mr. Olympia Classic Physique title</strong>, beginning a historic run that continued with victories in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, earning him a total of <strong data-start="1203" data-end="1244">six consecutive Olympia championships</strong>, the most in the division&rsquo;s history.</td>

      <td colspan="4">With this record-breaking streak, Bumstead cemented his legacy as the face of Classic Physique, helping popularize the division worldwide and inspiring millions with his blend of old-school physique ideals and modern training approaches. After winning his sixth Olympia title in 2024, he formally announced his retirement from competitive bodybuilding. He later made a brief appearance in the Men&rsquo;s Open division at the 2024 EVLS Prague Pro, placing second, before confirming he was fully stepping away from the stage. Beyond competition, Bumstead built a massive global fanbase through his authentic, humorous, and honest presence on social media, where he has openly discussed his struggles with autoimmune issues, injuries, stress, and the mental challenges of professional bodybuilding. He is also a successful entrepreneur with a fitness and lifestyle brand, and he continues to influence the fitness world through training content, mentorship, and public appearances. In his personal life, Chris has been in a long-term relationship with former Bikini Olympia champion Courtney King since 2018, and in April 2024 the couple welcomed their daughter, Bradley. Today, Chris Bumstead stands as an icon of modern bodybuilding—an athlete celebrated not only for his physique and competitive achievements but also for his humility, authenticity, and lasting impact on the sport.</td>
